# Machine-Learning

Hello! This is my page which includes code I have made for my machine learning and computational neuroscience modules. Here, you will find: 

1) 'ML_pipeline.py'- The code which was used for my machine learning report, where I aimed to use supervised learning to classify patients into Alzehimer's or non-Alzheimer's based on grey matter features. I tested a number of classification algorithms, including ExtraTrees, Logistic regression and K-Nearest neighbours.

2) 'GraphTheory.ipynb'- This code was composed to compare morphometric similarity measurements using graph theory in those with and without psychosis, to aid a more integrative understanding of schizophrenia.
